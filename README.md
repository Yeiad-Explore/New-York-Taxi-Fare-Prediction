# New York Taxi Fare Prediction

This repository contains a comparative analysis on predicting taxi fares in New York using Pandas and Apache Spark. The analysis is implemented in two Jupyter Notebooks: `NYC_Pandas.ipynb` for Pandas and `NYC_SparkF.ipynb` for Apache Spark.

## Description

The goal of this project is to compare the efficiency and performance of Pandas and Apache Spark for predicting taxi fares in New York. Two separate Jupyter Notebooks are provided, each implementing the prediction using Pandas and Apache Spark.

## Files

- `NYC.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `NYC_Pandas.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the prediction using Pandas.
- `NYC_SparkF.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing the prediction using Apache Spark.

## Usage

To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the `NYC_Pandas.ipynb` notebook for the Pandas analysis.
3. Open and run the `NYC_SparkF.ipynb` notebook for the Apache Spark analysis.

## Comparative Analysis

Both notebooks present a comparative analysis of the performance and efficiency of Pandas and Apache Spark for New York taxi fare prediction. Explore the findings and observations within each notebook.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required to run the Jupyter Notebooks:

- Pandas (for Pandas notebook)
- Apache Spark (for Spark notebook)

Ensure you have these dependencies installed before running the notebooks.
